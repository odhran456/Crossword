# Crossword

This is a program created in PyGame that allows you to play a crossword puzzle. 

Completed: 
- Board created
- Lettes can be put in tiles
- The computer can start guessing words to fit into a box and try to brute force solve the crossword. If they reach a point where no word in it's dictionary exists to fit inside a word, it removes otehr guesses it has for words interacting with this word and makes a new guess (backtracking algorithm)

TODO:
- Set up clues and correct words so a user can "play" the crossword and a win condition will exist
